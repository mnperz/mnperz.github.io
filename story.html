<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>My name is Michelle Perz. I have spent my whole life living it up in the Kansas City metro. I graduated from Norte Dame de Sion in 2010 and went off to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University of Kansas. That wasn't all as easy as that last sentence makes it sounds though. I switched majors four times, struggling to find just one thing I wanted to do. Having an artistic side and a history of loving math, I found computer science and graduated in 2015. It is the perfect combination of getting to solve problems with a creative, outside-of-the-box mindset and using logic and numbers to find the most effecient solution. <br/><br/>After graduating, I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to work at Perceptive Software as a software engineer for almost 2 full years. The company was amazing and the experience was life-changing. I did mostly Java development. After the company went through many structural changes, they downsized and I was laid-off. I decided that I wanted to shift fields a bit to gain experience with front-end development. I would love to get the opportunity to bring my artistic side out even more and design websites/work on UI or UX. This website is only the beginning of my projects in front-end development. :)</p>
